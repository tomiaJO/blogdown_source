## Hello There!

My name is Tamas Koncz and I work as a Data Scientist at Emarsys - I've joined just after finishing my MSc in Business Analytics at the Central European University. Earlier I spent 5 years at Morgen Stanley's Risk Management function, lastly as the lead of their business intelligence development team.  

I enjoy thinking about data topics (including, but definitely not limited to the analytics of NBA basketball). When not in front of a computer, I enjoy going for a hike, skiing, or spending some time with the two beautiful dogs of my family. And a good whisky occasionally. And planning how we will fit 8 Golden Retrievers into our flat with my lovely girlfriend, Niki (yes, we are both bit of a dog-maniac).

If you want to know more, or are interested in collaborating, please don't hesitate to reach out at t.koncz@gmail.com!
